                    <p>
                        My name is Yasmina and I am an undergraduate student at Boise State University studying Games,
                        Interactive Media and Mobile Technology with a minor in Creative Writing. My experience
                        encompasses game
                        development, web development, creative writing, and graphic design. I love writing intricate
                        storylines
                        with strong characters and stunning, imaginative worlds – especially when I get to take that
                        vision and
                        make it into a video game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My core skills include, but are not limited to, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Blueprints. Some
                        of my
                        technological proficiencies include Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Suite, Visual Studio/Visual
                        Studio
                        Code, Unity, and Unreal Engine. In terms of non-technical skills, I have demonstrated my ability
                        to
                        problem-solve difficult tasks, pay close attention to detail, and be organized and time
                        efficient.
                    </p>
